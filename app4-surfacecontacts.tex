\section{Rectangular foot contact}\label{sec.rectangular_foot}

Foot contact with the ground is the most common type of contact realized by
humanoid robots. A foot typically consists of one or two, if the robot has toes,
rigid bodies with flat soles. Contact of a sole with the ground is often
characterized by 3-dimensional contact forces applied at $N$ vertices of the
support polygon as shown in \cref{fig.friction_foot_vertex}
\cite{Kuindersma2014icra, Abe2007siggraph, Ott2011humanoids, Hauser2008ijrr}.
In this case, the interaction with the support surface is described by $3N$
force variables, which are redundant, since the number of degrees of freedom of
a rigid body does not exceed $6$. The redundancy leads to excessive number of
constraints and variables, which have negative impact on computational
performance and may cause numerical problems in solvers. For this reason, here
we consider a more concise representation of interaction between a rectangular
sole and support by a single wrench. The wrench is computed with respect to the
origin of a frame fixed to the middle of the sole as illustrated in
\cref{fig.friction_foot_center}. All variables used below in the derivations
are expressed in the said frame, therefore, appropriate transformations must be
performed to switch to the global frame.

Let us integrate over the support area $\SET{S}$ to obtain the total contact
force~\cite{Howe1996ijrr}
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        f^x\\
        f^y\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    &=
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \tilde{\friction}(x,y)
        \V{v}(x,y)
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    },\\
    f^z
    &=
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    }\label{eq.force_z_integral},
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
where $\V{v}(x,y)$ is a unit vector of the tangential contact force at a given
point, $\tilde{\friction}(x,y) \in [0, \friction]$ relates the norms of the
tangential and the normal forces, and integration is performed with respect to
$f^z(x,y) \ge 0$ to account for potential discontinuities in pressure
distribution. Norm of the tangential contact force reaches maximal value when
tangential forces at each point of $\SET{S}$ are collinear $\V{v}(x,y) = \V{v}$
and parameter $\tilde{\friction}(x,y)$ is equal to the friction coefficient
$\friction$, hence
%
\begin{equation}
    \V{f}^{xy}_{\MT{max}}
    =
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \friction
        \V{v}
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    }
    =
    \friction
    f^z
    \V{v}.
\end{equation}
%
This implies that the total tangential contact force is limited to the friction
cone, which can be linearized as described in \cref{sec.contact_constraints}.


We continue by obtaining the total contact moment
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \momentC^x\\
        \momentC^y\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    &=
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \begin{bmatrix}
            y\\
            -x
        \end{bmatrix}
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    }, \label{eq.moment_xy_integral}\\
    \momentC^z
    &=
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \tilde{\friction}(x,y)
        \begin{bmatrix}
            -y & x
        \end{bmatrix}
        \V{v}(x,y)
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    } \label{eq.moment_z_integral}.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%

First we focus on Equation~\cref{eq.moment_xy_integral}. It is straightforward
that the moments about the $x$ and $y$ axes take their maximal values, when the
normal contact force is applied at the respective edges of the support area,
\IE, when $x = \pm \ell$ or $y = \pm w$, consequently,
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq.moment_xy_bounds}
    -
    \begin{bmatrix}
        w\\
        \ell\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    f^z
    \le
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \momentC^x\\
        \momentC^y\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \le
    \begin{bmatrix}
        w\\
        \ell\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    f^z.
\end{equation}
%
Significance of these inequalities becomes clear after division of
\cref{eq.moment_xy_integral} by \cref{eq.force_z_integral}:
%
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{f^z}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \momentC^x\\
        \momentC^y\\
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \frac{
        \int_{\SET{S}}
        {
            \begin{bmatrix}
                y\\
                -x
            \end{bmatrix}
            \,
            df^z(x,y)
        }
    }
    {
        \int_{\SET{S}}
        {
            \,
            df^z(x,y)
        }
    }
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \copC^y\\
        -\copC^x
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
%
where $\cop = (\copC^x, \copC^y) = (-\momentC^y, \momentC^x) / \forceC^z$ is
position of \ac{CoP} of the contact pressure field. Thus, constraints
\cref{eq.moment_xy_bounds} imply that $\cop \in \SET{S}$, but they also remain
valid when \ac{CoP} is not defined, \IE, when $f^z = 0$. Furthermore,
\cref{eq.moment_xy_bounds} can be generalized to arbitrary convex polygonal
support areas, when the constraints take the following form \cite{Nagasaka2012}
%
\begin{equation}
    a \momentC^x + b \momentC^y \le c f^z,
\end{equation}
%
where $a,b,c$ are parameters of a line defining a face of the support polygon.


Analysis of Equation~\cref{eq.moment_z_integral} is more intricate. In order to
illustrate this let us assume that $\tilde{\friction}(x,y) = \tilde{\friction}$
and $\V{v}(x,y) = \V{v}$. Then
%
\begin{equation}
    \momentC^z
    =
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \tilde{\friction}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            -y & x
        \end{bmatrix}
        \V{v}
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    }
    =
    \tilde{\friction}
    \T{\V{v}}
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \begin{bmatrix}
            -y \\
            x
        \end{bmatrix}
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    }
    =
    -
    \tilde{\friction}
    \T{\V{v}}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \momentC^x \\
        \momentC^y
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
%
which can be multiplied by $\forceC^z$ to obtain
%
\begin{equation}
    \momentC^z \forceC^z
    =
    -
    \forceC^x
    \momentC^x
    -
    \forceC^y
    \momentC^y.
\end{equation}
%
Thus, under the assumption that all tangential forces are collinear, the moment
about the $z$ axis is nonlinearly determined by other components of the wrench.
In fact, under this assumption the total contact moment is computed by the
cross product of the \ac{CoP} position and the total contact force. In general,
however, we cannot make such assumption and should avoid nonlinear constraints.
Instead, we compute the absolute minimum and maximum of $\momentC^z$, which are
achieved when the origin of the frame is the center of rotation
%
\begin{equation}
    \V{v}
    =
    \pm
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        -y \\
        x
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
%
and $\tilde{\friction}(x,y) = \friction$. Hence, the bounds on $\momentC^z$ are
%
\begin{equation}
    \ubar{\momentC}^z
    =
    -
    \friction
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    },
    \quad
    \bar{\momentC}^z
    =
    \friction
    \int_{\SET{S}}
    {
        \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
        \,
        df^z(x,y)
    }.
\end{equation}
%
They reach the minimal (maximal) values when the normal contact force is
concentrated in the corners of $\V{S}$ with coordinates $(\pm \ell, \pm w)$, so
that
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq.moment_z_bounds}
    \ubar{\momentC}^z
    =
    -
    \friction
    \sqrt{\ell^2 + w^2}
    f^z,
    \quad
    \bar{\momentC}^z
    =
    \friction
    \sqrt{\ell^2 + w^2}
    f^z.
\end{equation}
%
Note that these bounds must be tighter if any of the following holds true:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\tilde{\friction}(x,y) < \friction$;
    \item the center of rotation does not coincide with the center of the foot;
    \item the pressure is not concentrated in the corners of $\SET{S}$.
\end{itemize}
However, constraints \cref{eq.moment_z_bounds} have found their application in
contact modeling due to their simplicity and linearity \cite{Fujimoto1996icra,
Bouchard2015gic}. Constraints of a similar form
%
\begin{equation}
    -\tilde{\friction} \forceC^z \le \momentC^z \le \tilde{\friction} \forceC^z,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\friction}$ is a certain torsional friction coefficient, are also applied
\cite{Mansour2013iros, Nagasaka2012}, especially in the works using the so
called \tn{soft finger} contact model for grasping
\cite[Chapter~5]{Murray1994mathematical}. Other approaches to limitation
of $\momentC^z$ include
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete omission of the bounds \cite{Stephens2010iros,
        Audren2014iros, Henze2014iros, Herzog2015auro}. This, however, is more
        dangerous than imposing \cref{eq.moment_z_bounds}.

    \item Construction of more elaborate bounds depending on $\moment^{xy}$ and
        $\force^{xy}$ \cite{Caron2015icra}. Unfortunately, obscurity of the
        derivations makes it difficult to analyze implications of these
        constraints.

    \item Derivation of the bounds based on certain assumptions about
        distribution of the contact pressure \cite{Zhu2006iros,
        Zhou2013robotica}.

    \item Use nonlinear bounds with some additional assumptions
        \cite[Chapter~5]{Yamane2004figures}.
\end{itemize}
%


We draw two conclusions from the present discussion: the total tangential
contact force is subject to Coulomb's friction constraints in the same way as
in the case of a point contact; the contact moments can and should be bounded
using \cref{eq.moment_xy_bounds} and \cref{eq.moment_z_bounds}, which are
summarized as
%
\begin{equation}
    \forceC^n
    \underbrace{
        \begin{bmatrix}
            -w\\
            -\ell\\
            -\sqrt{\ell^2 + w^2}
        \end{bmatrix}
    }_{\ubar{\moment}}
    \le
    \moment
    \le
    \forceC^n
    \underbrace{
        \begin{bmatrix}
            w\\
            \ell\\
            \sqrt{\ell^2 + w^2}
        \end{bmatrix}
    }_{\bar{\moment}}.
\end{equation}

\section{General surface contacts}\label{sec.surface_contacts}

Surface contacts are not necessarily rectangular: multiple contacts with the
same surface may lead to a support area of a rather complex shape. For example,
when the robot walks on a flat ground, it may have two foot contacts with the
ground at the same time. The support area in this case is the convex hull
$\SET{S}(\contact_1^{xy},\contact_2^{xy})$ of two rectangular feet with
positions $\contact_1^{xy}$ and $\contact_2^{xy}$ (see
\cref{fig.support_area_ctr}). Walking with coplanar contacts is so common that
some approximate models were specifically designed for this task, in
particular, the point-mass models considered in
\cref{sec.point_mass_planar,sec.point_mass_nonplanar}. For this reason, we
discuss general surface contacts in more detail here.


\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering{%
    \includegraphics{support_area_ctr.eps}}
    \caption[Constraints on position of the Center of Pressure.]{
        Grey area represents support area $\SET{S}(\contact_1^{xy},
        \contact_2^{xy})$ of two rectangular foot contacts.
    }
    \label{fig.support_area_ctr}
\end{figure}


From the preceding section it is clear that bounding of the tangential contact
forces is easy (see also \cref{sec.point_mass_nonlinear}). At the same time,
derivation of the bounds on the contact moment about the $z$ axis is nontrivial
even in the case of a simple rectangular shape. Therefore, we entirely focus on
the constraints on moments about the $x$ and $y$ axes. Provided that the normal
force is nonzero, these constraints are equivalent to constraints on the
\ac{CoP} position: $\cop \in \SET{S}(\contact_1^{xy}, \contact_2^{xy})$. One
way to express these constraints is to find faces of the support polygon and
force $\cop$ to stay on their inner side with inequality constraints. These
inequalities, however, are difficult to parametrize with respect to positions
$(\contact_1^{xy}, \contact_2^{xy})$ and orientations of the feet $(\theta_1,
\theta_2)$. Therefore, we consider constraints on the \ac{CoP} using a
different approach: we exploit the fact that as long as the \ac{CoP} lies
within the support area it is a convex combination of vertices $\V{v}_{i,j} \in
\RR^2$ with $i \in \{1,2\}$ and $j \in \{1,2,3,4\}$ of the rectangular foot
contacts shown in \cref{fig.support_area_ctr}.


Since the \ac{CoP} is a convex combination of vertices $\V{v}_{i,j}$, we express
it as
%
\begin{equation}
    \cop
    =
    \sum_{j=1}^{4}
    \left.
        \sum_{i=1}^{2}
            \eta_{i,j} \V{v}_{i,j}
    \right.
    ,
    \quad
    \sum_{j=1}^{4}
    \left.
        \sum_{i=1}^{2}
            \eta_{i,j}
    \right.
    =
    1,
    \quad
    \eta_{i,j}
    \ge
    0
    .
\end{equation}
%
Let us denote positions of vertices of a given foot expressed in a frame fixed
to its center as $\V{v}_{\{1,2,3,4\}}$. Then $\V{v}_{i,j} = \hatM[i]{R}\V{v}_j
+ \contact_i^{xy}$, where $\hatM[i]{R}$ is a rotation matrix depending on
$\theta_i$. Hence,
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        &
        \cop
        =
        \sum_{j=1}^{4}
        \left(
            \left(
            \sum_{i=1}^{2}
                \eta_{i,j} \hatM[i]{R}
            \right)
            \V{v}_{j}
        \right)
        +
        \left(
        \sum_{j=1}^{4}
            \eta_{1,j}
        \right)
        \hatM[1]{R}
        \contact_1^{xy}
        +
        \left(
        \sum_{j=1}^{4}
            \eta_{2,j}
        \right)
        \hatM[2]{R}
        \contact_2^{xy}
        ,
        \\
        &
        \sum_{j=1}^{4}
        \left.
            \sum_{i=1}^{2}
                \eta_{i,j}
        \right.
        =
        1,
        \quad
        \eta_{i,j}
        \ge
        0
        .
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
Since $\V{v}_{j}$ are constant, the \ac{CoP} position is determined by
coefficients $\eta_{i,j}$, foot positions $\contact_i^{xy}$, and foot
orientations $\theta_i$. This relation is linear in several cases:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Positions and orientations of the feet are fixed. Then variables
        $\eta_{i,j}$ determine position of the \ac{CoP}.

    \item Orientations of the feet are fixed and distribution of the pressure
        between the feet is known, \IE,
        %
        \begin{equation}
            \sum_{j=1}^{4}
                \eta_{1,j}
            =
            \MT{const}
            ,
            \quad
            \sum_{j=1}^{4}
                \eta_{2,j}
            =
            \MT{const}.
        \end{equation}
        %
        In this case positions of the feet and, to some extent, position of the
        \ac{CoP} can vary.

    \item There is only one contact with the surface and orientation of the
        foot is fixed. Then, in addition to position of the \ac{CoP} within the
        foot, the position of the foot can vary. This allows to anticipate
        walking motions without predetermined contact positions
        \cite{Herdt2010auro, Sherikov2014humanoids}.
\end{itemize}
%


Though nonlinear \ac{MPC} allows to handle nonlinear constraints on the
\ac{CoP} position \cite{Naveau2016ral}, in practice it is common to employ
approximations, for example,
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Support area in a double support can be approximated using support
        area of a single support, which is translated and oriented
        appropriately as demonstrated in \cref{fig.ds_approximation}
        \cite{Dimitrov2011icra}, \cite[Chapter~3]{Sherikov2012master}.

        %
        \begin{figure}[ht]
            \centering{%
            \includegraphics{ds_approximation.eps}}
            \caption[Approximation of the support area in a double support.]{
                Approximation of the support area in a double support with
                support area of a single support.
            }
            \label{fig.ds_approximation}
        \end{figure}
        %

    \item The support area does not depend on foot orientations in the case of
        point or round feet. Therefore, we can constrain the \ac{CoP} positions
        to conservative round support areas as illustrated in
        \cref{fig.support_rotations} \cite{Lafaye2014humanoids}. This
        guarantees that the \ac{CoP} position always stays within the real
        support area. Alternatively, orientations of the feet can be
        precomputed using a dedicated \ac{MPC} scheme as proposed in
        \cite[Chapter~2]{Herdt2012thesis},

This repository contains TeX sources of my PhD thesis, which was defended at
ComUE Universit√© Grenoble Alpes in 2016. The TeX style files were taken from
several other thesis templates, which, unfortunately, I cannot find anymore.
You are free to use the TeX files in this repository to make a template for
your own thesis, however, if you want to reuse figures, please, contact me
first (send me an email to  asherikov at yandex.com).


Features:

    1.  All temporary files are kept in 'tmp' folder.

    2.  You can visualize differences from a previous version of the thesis in
    the git repository using latexdiff: 'make latexdiff REVISION=<oldrevision>'
    I modified latexdiff script to add support for 'LXDINPUTS' evironment
    variable, which specifies additional paths to search for included '*.tex'
    files. The original version of latexdiff requires complete paths.

    3.  You can delete unreferenced bibliography entries and comments from
    thesis.bib file using 'make bibfilter'. For this purpose I use *.awk
    scripts from bibextract.

    4.  Note that everything except the title page is in English. Some of the
    styles were originally in French.
